# Pharma Sales Visualization

Hi, I’m Mangesh — with 15+ years in pharmaceutical sales. This project is my way of combining real-world experience with data science skills. I've taken a sample sales dataset and visualized it using Python to uncover patterns that help in marketing and business planning.

 What This Does

Using basic tools like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, this script:
- Shows total sales by region (bar chart)
- Tracks monthly sales trends (line graph)
- Highlights which products are doing well (pie chart)
- Compares product sales across regions (heatmap)

##  Files

- `visulization.sale.py` – the main Python script
- `sales_data.csv` – sample data (inside `/data`)
- `Sales by Region and Product(heatmap.png`) – auto-generated chart (inside `/images`)

##  How to Run

1. Install requirements:
```bash
